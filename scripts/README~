Steps
For each subject

- Run "freesurferPrep.sh subID dicomSource"
   - Create subject dir and convert all scans from DICOM to nifti (d???/nii)
   - Does bias field correction with fsl_anat
   - Convert to freesurfer format 
- Run freesurfer with flags for hippo SF segmentation
    recon-all -s d??? -all -no-isrunning -openmp 4 -hippocampal-subfields-T1 
- Align the two hippo scans together (t2HipAlgn.sh)
- Run t2regs.sh which will
  - Align the t2wb to T1_biascorr (FSL, epi_reg)
  - Align the hipp_algn_avg to the t2wb (flirt)
  - Combine the two transforms above to get hipp to T1_biascorr (FSL tools)
  - Convert transform from FSL format to ITK format (c2d_affine_tool)
  - For both the left and right hippocampus
     - Apply transform above to get hipp_t2s to freesurfer hipp sf label space
     - Apply identity transform to T1_biascorr with the hipp sf label as ref

Once this is done for all subjects, we can run the ANTS buildTemplate script to warp the subjects together. Docs to be written.
